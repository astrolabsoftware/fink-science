 # Flux standardization module

 This module adds two new columns for a set of sources defined beforehand. 
 These sources are blazars that the CTAO collaboration wants to monitor starting the launch of the South and North sites. 
 The new columns are the **standardized flux** (which is the flux over the median flux computed beforhand using archival light curves of ZTF) and the **uncertainties** over this standardized flux.
